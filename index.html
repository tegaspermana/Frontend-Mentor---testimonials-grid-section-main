                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                  learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                  joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                  the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                  enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                  - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                  course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                  Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                  and learning from their experiences was easy.</h5>

                  genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
                  refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
                  able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get

              Highly recommended!</h5>
            <p class="card-text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never
              written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
              who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
              enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
              things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
              disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
              assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
              It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
              could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
              interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
              helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
              multiple offers. 100% recommend!”</p>
